# SNemo_track_reconstruction

In order to accurately map out the electron tracks, the behaviour of the electron propagation through the tracker cells must be well understood.
This study investigates the electron drift model of the experiment, providing a radial position and uncertainty of the electron in the cell from a given drift time. This study also
provides a comprehensive review of the electric field, pressure, and angular dependencies
of electron drift for future use in both track-fitting and simulation.

The aim of this project is to create a detailed electron drift model, described in Chapter
5, which describes the horizontal propagation of the emitted electrons in the trackerâ€™s
drift cells, returning a radial distance and its corresponding uncertainty. The aim is to
combine this with the vertical position reconstruction, so that a full 3D reconstruction of
the electron tracks can be done.
